<!-- Write a short note on Tag and element with an example -->

<!-- Ans:-   

HTML Tags are the starting and ending parts of an HTML element. They begin with < symbol and end with > symbol. Whatever is written inside < and > are called tags.

The HTML element consists of both the opening and closing tags as well as whatâ€™s inside those tags. It normally consists of some structure thatâ€™s used to define the respective tags.
